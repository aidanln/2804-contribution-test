To determine the number of ordered triples $ (A, B, C) $ such that $ A \subseteq S $, $ B \subseteq S $, $ C \subseteq S $, and $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ are pairwise disjoint, we start by analyzing the choices available for each element in the set $ S $.

Given $ S $ is a set with $ n $ elements, each element $ x in S $ must belong to one of the sets $ A $, $ B $, $ C $, or to none of these sets. These four choices for each element are:

+ $ x \in A $
+ $ x \in B $
+ $ x \in C $
+ $ x \notin A \cup B \cup C $

Since the elements of $ S $ are independently distributed among these four choices, each element has 4 options. Therefore, for each of the $ n $ elements, there are 4 independent choices.

$ 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot ... \cdot 4$

Hence, the total number of ways to assign each of the $ n $ elements to either $ A $, $ B $, $ C $, or none of them is $ 4^n $.

Thus, the total number of ordered triples $ (A, B, C) $ where $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ are pairwise disjoint subsets of $ S $ is: $ 4^n $

So, the number of such ordered triples is $\boxed{4^n}$.
